# Packaged HASHI Engine Runtime (HER)

This directory documents HASHI-owned packaging for the built-in **HASHI Engine
Runtime (HER)**. HER is derived from the MIT-licensed Claw runtime; the original
Claw copyright and license notice remain distributed as `CLAW_LICENSE`.

Contract:

- `hashi_assets/her/manifest.json` is the runtime source of truth.
- Binary paths in the manifest must stay relative to `hashi_assets/her`.
- Every packaged binary must declare a pinned SHA-256 digest.
- Packaged discovery fails closed on checksum mismatch.
- Operators may choose `prefer-packaged`, `require-packaged`, or `system-only`.
- Versioned binaries live under `hashi_assets/her/releases/`.
- `scripts/her_runtime_probe.py` verifies HER runtime discovery and diagnostics.
- `scripts/verify_her_certification.py` verifies the pinned upstream Claw source
  against HER's certification baseline.

Public HASHI configuration uses the backend ID `her`. The legacy `her` ID
is accepted only as a migration alias.
